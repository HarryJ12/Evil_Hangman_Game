Evil Hangman is a Hangman game using C in which the program adapts to player guesses by reorganizing word families to maximize difficulty. Instead of committing to a single word, it dynamically shifts between the largest possible families to avoid revealing letters and make the game intentionally challenging.

Custom data structures, including a string ADT, a generic vector, and an AVL tree manage dictionary words efficiently. The implementation relies on dynamic memory management, recursion, and balancing algorithms to keep performance tight even with large datasets.
